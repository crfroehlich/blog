Certainly, it is a testament to our social nature. We live or die upon our ability to interact socially. That we should have incorporated this social dependence into childbirth is interesting. Interesting, if only to me. I do not pretend to own some greater understanding of this little mystery; but the panda and the polar bear raise their children alone.
