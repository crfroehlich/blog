The lamplight, street lights, they play tricks with your\\nmind. You stand here, for hours on the street corner, your\\noverly made-up lips tugging on a cheap cigarette; your arms\\nwrapped tightly about you as you shiver in the cold. There\\nmight be a moon, there might not.. you can never tell with the\\nglow of the light above you.. Light pollution, they call it.\\nBut all the same, you can't see the stars from right here,\\neven without the light, the smog of this city would block them.\\nSometimes I sit here, hugging the post as if it will hold me\\nback. Sometimes, I just hold the post, feeling the cold\\ndistance of the metal as it rests against my body. Sometimes\\nit is comforting, the post is there: it is always cold and always\\nrough to the touch; but it is constant. Sometimes it is\\nterrifying.. as if I am afraid that it will become something that\\nit is not.. that one day it will change and become warm and\\nclose, that it might hold me back.

You\\naren't particularly afraid, but annoyed. Another lost drunk to deal\\nwith. But then you blink, and he vanishes. And you realize he\\nwas merely a wraith in the darkness, nothing real. And then you'll\\nturn your eyes downward, sometimes after it has just rained, and\\nthere, in the street, will be a puddle where several drops of oil have\\nfallen. And a thousand different colors of red and blue and green in\\ndistorted swirls that speak of people's lives stretched out and twisted\\nand yet strangely beautiful. They wrap about each other as you shift\\nyour stance, almost writhing on the street. You can see fear and pain\\nand love and death in the people's eyes; you can see them looking\\nback at you. Staring up at you. They watch you. But you are not\\nparanoid, for they cannot harm you. And again you blink and they are\\ngone, except for a vague memory still resting like a single page atop\\na desk of cluttered papers, where you can sometimes distinguish it\\nfrom the rest, but just barely.
