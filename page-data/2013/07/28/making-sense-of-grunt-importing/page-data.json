Plugins are NPM packages tailored specifically to run as Grunt tasks.  \\n  \\n\\n### Step 3: Identify Your Files\\n\\n  \\n\\nGrunt has access to the file system, but it does not know which files to process or how to think about them, so you must define the set of files you want Grunt to operate on. There are various ways to do this, but I prefer managing files in a dedicated configuration file.  \\n\\n1.  Create an asset list _(e.g. /web/files.js)_\\n\\n1.  ```\\n    module.exports.app = \\\\[  \\n        'app/js/NameSpace.js',  \\n        'app/js/\\\\*\\\\*/\\\\*.js'  \\n    \\\\];  \\n      \\n    module.exports.css = \\\\[  \\n        'app/css/\\\\*\\\\*/\\\\*.css'  \\n    \\\\];  \\n      \\n    module.exports.vendorMin = \\\\[  \\n        'vendor/js/modernizr-2.6.2.min.js',  \\n        'vendor/js/es5-shim.min.js',  \\n        'vendor/js/jquery-2.0.3.min.js',  \\n        'vendor/js/q.min.js'  \\n    \\\\];  \\n      \\n    module.exports.vendor = \\\\[  \\n        'vendor/js/modernizr-2.6.2.js',  \\n        'vendor/js/es5-shim.js',  \\n        'vendor/js/jquery-2.0.3.js',  \\n        'vendor/js/q.js'  \\n    \\\\];  \\n      \\n    module.exports.images = \\\\[  \\n        'app/img/\\\\*\\\\*/\\\\*.png',  \\n        'app/img/\\\\*\\\\*/\\\\*.gif'  \\n    \\\\];\\n    ```\\n\\nWe'll later instruct Grunt to consume this file into a variable, and the \\\\`modules.exports\\\\` syntax will instruct Grunt to export each property as a member of the return object. Grunt also supports a range of globbing patterns--'\\\\*\\\\*' is the simplest way to include all files and folders beneath the path, recursively.  \\n  \\n\\n### Step 4: Create the Gruntfile\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe Gruntfile is by far the most complex piece, so for the purpose of this guide, I'll focus on only three tasks: compiling JavaScript, compiling CSS and cleaning the release folder.  \\n\\n1.  Create a file named Gruntfile.js _(e.g. /web/Gruntfile.js)_\\n\\n1.  _```\\n    /\\\\*global module:false\\\\*/  \\n    module.exports = function (grunt) {  \\n          \\n        var files = require('./files'); //Load files.js into a local variable  \\n      \\n        grunt.initConfig({  \\n      files: files, //store the files variable inside the grunt config object  \\n        \\n     pkg: grunt.file.readJSON('package.json'),  \\n      \\n            clean: \\\\['release'\\\\],  \\n      \\n            cssmin: {  \\n                files: {  \\n                    src: files.css,  \\n                    dest: 'release/mycss.min.css'  \\n                }  \\n            },  \\n      \\n            uglify: {  \\n                files: {  \\n                    src: files.app,  \\n                    dest: 'release/myjs.min.js'  \\n                }  \\n            }  \\n        });  \\n      \\n        grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-clean');  \\n        grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-cssmin');  \\n        grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify');  \\n      \\n        grunt.registerTask('compile', \\\\['clean', 'cssmin', 'uglify'\\\\]);  \\n    };\\n    ```_\\n\\nI keep my Gruntfile broken into three purely conceptual sections. First, there is the variable initialization before calling \\\\`_grunt.initConfig_\\\\`. This just makes it clear that I am assigning some content outside of the Grunt init.  \\n  \\nSecond, there is the required call to \\\\`_grunt.initConfig_\\\\`. This is the core of the file. All common task configuration is done here. The names of the properties in this object usually map to the names of the associated task to run.  \\n  \\nThird, there is the task initialization and task identification section. Here, \\\\`_grunt.loadNpmTasks_\\\\` is called to load a plugin for use in Grunt. This plugin must be installed and identified as a dependency in package.json. (installation happens automatically when you install your project). You can also define additional tasks to run by calling \\\\`grunt.registerTask\\\\`  \\n  \\nThe [clean](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-clean) task is the most straightforward. Given an array of folder names, it will delete their contents. [Cssmin](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-cssmin) will concatenate and compile CSS files into a single, compressed file. Likewise, [uglify](https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-contrib-uglify) will take your JS files, concatenate and compile them into a minified file.  \\n  \\nMy custom task, 'compile' simply cleans the 'release' folder and then compiles the CSS and JS back into release.  \\n  \\n\\n### Step 5: Release\\n\\n  \\n\\nOnce the pieces are in place, putting them together is a one-two:\\n\\n1.  cd into the project directory (e.g./web/)\\n2.  Install the project\\n\\n1.  ```\\n    npm install\\n    ```\\n\\n4.  Compile the project\\n\\n1.  ```\\n    grunt compile\\n    ```\\n\\n  \\nI'm sure most of this was quite obvious to rest of the community, but it took me some considerable iteration to get it right. While it seems intuitive to me now, I thought it worth documenting from my own experience. You can see the entire [Grunt configuration](https://github.com/somecallmechief/oj/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for my own project, [OJ](https://github.com/somecallmechief/oj/) on Github.  \\n  \\nThese steps are enough to begin making headway, but they are by no means enough to get your entire project fully migrated into Grunt. Next time, I'll discuss how to dynamically generate my project's HTML using Grunt tasks.\\n\\nexport const _frontmatter = {\\\"title\\\":\\\"Making Sense of Grunt metaTitle: \\\",\\\"Making Sense of Grunt\\\":\\\"Importing an Existing Project'\\\",\\\"metaDate\\\":\\\"7/28/2013\\\",\\\"metaDraft\\\":false,\\\"aliases\\\":[\\\"/2013/07/making-sense-of-grunt-importing.html\\\"],\\\"tags\\\":[\\\"Grunt\\\",\\\"npm\\\",\\\"nodejs\\\",\\\"javascript\\\"]}\\n\")));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#step-1-what-is-grunt","title":"Step 1: What is Grunt?"},{"url":"#step-2-your-project-is-now-an-npm-package","title":"Step 2: Your Project is Now an NPM Package"}]},"parent":{"__typename":"File","relativePath":"2013/07/28/making-sense-of-grunt-importing.md"},"frontmatter":{"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"metaDate":"7/28/2013"}},"allMdx":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/","title":"Welcome"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/welcome","title":"Welcome"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/05/02/adjustments","title":"adjustments"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/15/toes","title":"toes"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2007/defer","title":"defer"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/20/mistake","title":"mistake"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/18/linger","title":"linger"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/23/in-end","title":"in the end"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/30/blastphemy","title":"blastphemy"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/27/on-bubbles","title":"on bubbles"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/26/beneath","title":"beneath"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/25/parched","title":"parched"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2003/05/28/purged-by-fire","title":"Purged By Fire"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2003/05/16/one-last-hoorah","title":"One Last Hoorah"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/22/earnest","title":"earnest"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2000/04/26/time-sensitive","title":"time sensitive"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2003/08/16/story-of-boy-and-his-ambition","title":"The Enemy (AKA Those Who Have Been Liberated) Revisited metaTitle: "}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/1998/08/11/mollie","title":"Mollie"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/1998/08/11/lamplight","title":"Lamplight"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2003/10/04/the-swift-hand-of-the-enemy","title":"The Swift Hand of The Enemy (AKA Those Who Have Been Liberated)"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/1998/08/11/mussel","title":"Mussel"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2003/12/03/cig_russian","title":"Can''t Talk No Jive"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2003/07/06/war-against-the-enemy","title":"War Against the Enemy (AKA Those Who Have Been Liberated)"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2004/04/25/yes","title":"Yes!"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2003/11/05/wishing-wells-away","title":"Wishing Wells Away"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/05/28/bait","title":"Bait."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/05/28/rejected-personal-description-from-yahoo","title":"Rejected Personal Description from Yahoo"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2002/06/19/in-title","title":"In Title"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/03/28/elastic-vengeance","title":"elastic vengeance"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2006/07/14/this-country-does-not-exist","title":"this country does noT exist"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2004/05/09/local-news_9","title":"Local News"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2004/05/28/public-concern-rises-as-treatment-of","title":"Public Concern Rises as Treatment of Prisoners Declines"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2004/05/15/local-news","title":"Local News"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/2004/06/23/baal-is-dead-i-killed-him","title":"Baal is Dead;
