Well, in the same right, it is the job of the great minds to do some amount of thinking. I say, it\\u2019s their job, you know.

I mean, of course, have you studied? Have you been to university? Have you trained? Have you researched and conferred with peers the same caliber as yourself? No? Well, I am not such a man to be arrogant about these things. Not so proud that I dare to challenge what men smarter than myself have learned. Do you not think they are men just like yourself, with the best intentions? Men after the Truth? Men looking out for the good of their work and the pursuit of freedom? Do you not? These are men of science, George. Men of Progress. Yes. Now, I know you, George. You\\u2019re no more arrogant than I am. No, clearly not. You\\u2019re right of course, men have ideas. You have ideas. This is the right and proper thing for men to do. But more than this, George, we must learn how to express ourselves. That\\u2019s the thing. Thoughts crave expression.
