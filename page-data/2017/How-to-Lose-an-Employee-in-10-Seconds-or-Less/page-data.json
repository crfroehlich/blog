This duo had various other LLCs to account for other revenue streams (public speaking engagements, university teaching, publications), and it was never clear over which any or all of these I was intended to function (in spirit) as CTO. In the end, I was offered a salary to be paid out from a line item in a government grant\\u2019s budget, managed by a one of an out of state university\\u2019s many extension offices.

Excuses were in no short supply: government grant policies had changed over the last year, new university extension policies on the distribution of grant funds had changed, my line item status on the grant was continually wrong from week to week to week, authorization was needed for my salary, and so forth.

Perhaps, in no small part having the anxiety of the foreclosure of the house behind me, the battleground for optimism had once again become to seem ripe for the taking. By August, my alimony payments had dropped considerably. I moved my family into an apartment. We were out of the basement.

We would be restricted in our yearly budgeting to spending the total sum of the grant divided by the duration of the grant. So, if our grant were $5 and the grant duration were 5 years, our yearly budget could not exceed $1. This completely dismembered the budget discussions and roadmap planning that had occurred a few weeks prior. We had calculated that we could use nearly 60% of the total grant in the first year to accelerate development and partition the remainder for the remaining years. This revelation eliminated my own budget in its entirety.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Shortly after starting, I was left with no budget and no auxiliary means to finance development outside of employing myself for longer hours.

One developer alone, no matter how gifted, had no chance of delivering against our roadmap on our timeline.

At a few points, I found prospective college students who might make promising interns, but the duo insisted that any new hires of any type work without compensation in exchange for letters of recommendation\\u200A\\u2014\\u200Aa practice neither myself or any of my applicants could abide.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Absent any additional hours I could add to the day\\u2019s clock by leveraging new hires, the duo helpfully offered to let their high school aged children babysit my own, while I worked longer hours.
