Most projects start with a fairly predictable set of questions: what language(s) are we going to write this thing in, what type of application is this, and where are we going to store the data? Vast amounts of our data is purely relational; equal volumes of equally critical data isn\\u2019t.

Our first table committed to code is a simple dictionary of Ids and Types. Every other table inherits from this base table, which means that given any valid Id, I can find the corresponding dog, cat, person or object with no extra information.

Diabolical bugs can lurk by manner of a single typo in a template, waiting to reproduce themselves across hundreds of files with the click of a button. Whitespace changes annoy to the extreme. We can (usually do) anticipate and surmount many of these hurdles. Frequent commits guarantee that noise doesn\\u2019t swallow avoidable faults.
