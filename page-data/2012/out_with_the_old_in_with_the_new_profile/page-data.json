You don\\u2019t think about potatoes in their most mortal sense when you\\u2019re a disaffected, drug-addicted youth. We buried him in the backyard pool, which we filled with plankton. Sometimes, when the moon\\u2019s just right, you can still see the flies swarming over his grave.\\nThe cannibalism of the years that followed seems only natural when compared with the vegan gluttony of our youths. My sisters and I began working as shoe salesmen for local choir boys, but only the family dog really had a talent for it. We hired and fired Egyptian slaves, but Scandal had other games for us to play. The first sister died from salmonella poisoning at Disney Land. It was Vogue and en vogue that caught the nation\\u2019s attention.\\nSchool was compulsory, of course; and those of us that remained largely ignored it. We studied particle physics in the garage and practiced fencing on the roof. The second sister died of dark matter exposure, and we burned her on a funeral pyre of our own making. The seventh sister was immaculately conceived that year. In these early years, we invested heavily in Swedish bubble gum and nineteenth century guns. It was a time of self reflection and turbulent bathing.\")));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"}},"pageContext":{"id":"c621b266-db3c-54ee-9adc-53a2c2176ad3","slug":"/2012/out_with_the_old_in_with_the_new_profile","previous":{"fields":{"id":"7f107ddf-6e2c-52c2-aa68-83baa7e796cd","title":"Performance!
