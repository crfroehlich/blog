As 3rd ID abandoned us 1st AD folks, leaving us to the wolves and would-be wolves, the not-quite-yet wolves, and the wolves-with-better-things-to-do-than-wolfing wolves, the enemy (aka those who had been liberated) again bared his teeth, showing his continued resistance to the march of democracy, revealing his hidden alliances to the former regime, practically admitting to the private production of chemical weapons with the intent of killing sweet, innocent American babies, by suggesting that he,\\xA0the enemy (aka those who had been liberated)\\xA0himself, would shut down this fine computer lab due to \\u201Cdecreased demand.\\u201D Why, these fellows haven\\u2019t caught on to the whole point of capitalism at all. If Smith tells us anything, it\\u2019s that it doesn\\u2019t matter whether demand be real or perceived\\u2014create it if you must, but never\\u2014EVER claim that it doesn\\u2019t exist! People will buy because you tell them they must. This is the moral foundation of our great nation. This is why we wage wars. This is why\\xA0the Enemy (aka those who have been liberated)\\xA0lost, and\\xA0the Enemy (aka those who have been liberated)\\xA0must change!\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I explained all of this to him, of course, through my trusty government sponsored interpreter (who is also, coincidentally, sponsored by Nike); but\\xA0the Enemy (aka those who had been liberated)\\xA0seemed more inclined to dismantle this fine lab than to give me cheap and immediate access to my beloved internet. In the end, I prevailed; though I must admit, I think the corporate sponsorship swayed the battle for me. Did you, for example, know that Pepsi is now sponsoring a full 45f all combat raids in New Baghdad? Our HMMVWWVMSMWNSXMMVS look very sheik with a cool, clean, morally satisfying Pepsi logo pasted across the side.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"But I digress. To the internet I came. I typed for you a very brilliant, very emotionally evocative, very wise and sober email about my condition, the condition of\\xA0the enemy (aka those who had been liberated)\\xA0 and the profound relationship between a good, hot bath (where the water is just the right temperature, and you get to soak for a solid 10 minutes before the first person starts banging on the door, screaming, \\u201CWhen are you going to be done in there, you lazy, incompetent buffoon? 27 people are waiting outside\\u2026\\u201D) and a cup of coffee (when you\\u2019ve just had a large, satisfying breakfast, and the coffee is oh-so-hot and the sun is just starting to rise, and you just lit the bowl of your pipe to watch blue wisps of smoke unfurl into the morning air, and you heave a sigh of relaxation and peace before the first person starts to shout, \\u201CHey, why aren\\u2019t you working? Didn\\u2019t you see this stack of reports that need to be entered? Who said you could smoke in here?\\u201D before the resounding thud of a brick smashes their big toe), when the power went out.
