As 3rd ID abandoned us 1st AD folks, leaving us to the wolves and would-be wolves, the not-quite-yet wolves, and the wolves-with-better-things-to-do-than-wolfing wolves, the enemy (aka those who had been liberated) again bared his teeth, showing his continued resistance to the march of democracy, revealing his hidden alliances to the former regime, practically admitting to the private production of chemical weapons with the intent of killing sweet, innocent American babies, by suggesting that he,\\xA0the enemy (aka those who had been liberated)\\xA0himself, would shut down this fine computer lab due to \\\"decreased demand.\\\" Why, these fellows haven't caught on to the whole point of capitalism at all. If Smith tells us anything, it's that it doesn't matter whether demand be real or perceived--create it if you must, but never--EVER claim that it doesn't exist! People will buy because you tell them they must. This is the moral foundation of our great nation. This is why we wage wars.

In the end, I prevailed; though I must admit, I think the corporate sponsorship swayed the battle for me.
