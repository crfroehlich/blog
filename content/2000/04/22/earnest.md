How can we propose to fashion for ourselves life or livelihood - an attempt to
        order the pieces of a puzzle when we have neither the will nor the 
        ability to see the portrait for what it might have been rather than what
        has been, in so bleak a way, assembled to represent happiness, laughter - 

And at what juncture do we cease the self-proclamation of Godhood and
        admit to ourselves that we have never once given serious attention to
        Truth, but to the rules that define our physical world.

    When I die, I wish to breath my own blood as I scream in agony pure and
    intense. Slowly, slowly that I may earn the breaths that I took in vain.
