Relative Motors today announced plans to cut carbon emissions in half, by converting dangerous carbon dioxide emissions into harmless carbon monoxide emissions. RM spokesman, Donald Thisbit, told reporters: "Carbon dioxide as we all know is One molecule carbon, TWO molecules oxygen. Today, Relative Motors will cut half the oxygen out of our vehicle emissions. That's half the waste. We feel at RM that carbon monoxide is the gateway to a greener planet and a sustainable future."
