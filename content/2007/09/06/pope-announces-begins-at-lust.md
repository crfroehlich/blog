Part-time Vice Cardinal at the Vatican, Donald Thisbit, revealed to AP reporters this morning the results of the Pope's revelations on the true point of entry for new souls into the universe. "Lust", he said, "initiates an inter dimensional spiritual phone call, bringing the next new soul to the front of the line in preparation to enter existence." Thisbit also announced the Vatican's new anti-lust research policy, calling psychology a platform of genocide on the largest possible scale.
