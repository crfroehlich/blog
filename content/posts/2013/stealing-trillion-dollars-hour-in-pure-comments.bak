Unfortunately people try and take advantage of the fact that there's a loose definition of "intellectual property" and "innovation."

Take [what Soverain Software tried to to do NewEgg](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2414778,00.asp) in January or Apples [patent](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/06/apple-patents-the-macbook-airs-wedge-design-bad-news-for-ultrabook-makers/) on their...innovative...design.

It takes defending your intellectual rights to a whole new level.

This reminds me of RIAA's claim that Limewire created damages worth $75 trillion to them, more than the entire Earth's GDP. Digital value is not measured like physical stuff.

\> By now, I think it fairly safe to say that no one seriously disputes the fact that intellectual property infringement is no different than all other forms of theft (either literally or figuratively).

It is different, in that, it isn't theft. Art is IP and other than trademarking, there is no sane protection. The same is true of IP, regardless of spin by the \*AA or blogosphere.

I guess if I have to come back and say, "by the way, this is satirical", I probably didn't do a great job on this one.
