It comes at that time in the early morning when the throat clenches about the fist and a fast cry surges toward the stomach: "something is missing". I am meant for something great. What is self or greatness? I do not hesitate to abstain from speculation. What matters at the end of the day? How many men on this earth ate bread tonight? Has that percentage improved since yesterday? If not, what are our plans to change that? From the poorest child's access to bread, the whole spectrum becomes clear--  
  
Suffering will always exist if we do not sacrifice. Christ died in vain.
