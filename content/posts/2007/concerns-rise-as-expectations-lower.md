title: Concerns Rise as Expectations Lower
---

Area residents of Watkins Glen, Arizona today noted increasing concern over their own lowered expectations. Said Donald Thisbit, elementary school teacher of his students, "I just couldn't care less about their education--and that frightens the heck out of me." Wilford Mansfield, owner of the Dapper Dangler grocery store, expressed frustration with plummeting sales: "We've posted record losses every quarter for the past seven quarters, and I couldn't be more concerned about how little I care."
