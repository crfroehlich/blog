I wonder if teething is nature's way of driving parents towards insanity.Â  I remember times looking at my own parents with the hypothesis that they were indeed crazier than a band of mango/chicken hybrids, but I'm now getting closer to the truth of it.

It may just be the only way to deal with the pain: desanitification.
