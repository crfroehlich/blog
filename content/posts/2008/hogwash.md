It's strange that in the largest (and first) economic crisis of our century, the streets are calm and the crowds quiet.  Entire countries' economies have collapsed in the past few months.  Within the U.S., every investment bank has collapsed.  We no longer have a single investment bank in our borders.  Almost all of the central banks are both hoarding money and hemoraging assets.  Global companies are shutting down.  DHL, GM, Ford.  Retailers are rotting from the inside.  Commercial paper is scarce, inter bank lending is still largely frozon, and everyone with assets is terrified.  
  
This terror somehow escapes the average American.  Unemployment rises each day, yet panic is the furthest thing from our minds.  Some of us are conscious of the looming giant but are incapable of doing anything about it.  Others blissfully walk the streets, unaware that the sky is prepared to swallow them whole.  
  
The illusion of security is still relatively strong.
