never before and never since have I awoken with the force of another man's fist in my face.  there is a time, in my past, when I woke to the blurred forms of socks filled with soap and padlocks flying toward my restrained form.  there is no one to hear that scream.

when one can bleed in the view of the public, and when the public chooses to ignore the bloody masses...

all fuck has gone to fuck, excuse my german.
