At times I wish only that my heart would open inside my mind,
that I might cry with new sorrow and weep new tears of salt and mist.
But I am hard and stubborn and have only a vague idea
of what beauty may or may not be.

Why write and for what humanity? To be a child...
To be again loved as a child; to again yearn for the self indulgence indulged a child...
    yet more than death waits
        for those who wait
            for love
