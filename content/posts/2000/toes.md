Of the days that dwell within
    the numbness of my toes
    and the hours spent in
    concentration quiet and intense -

Blankness in some guise has
     found me with clamped eyes
     and pinched nostrils,
     leaning back into the fall
    and looking only at the
    retreating face of imagination
    and hope.

I trust that resolves the issue.
