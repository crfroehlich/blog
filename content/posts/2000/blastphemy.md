Of all the emptiness and disdain -
    for which I have no explanation
    but the mass consumption of human spirit - 
    the lengths to which man (myself, foremost of the cast)
        will to which
        and find his own destruction;
    the manner in which we cast ourselves the
    fool and the lonely lot of living in open
        graves - 

I have found nothing to prove myself
    holy, nor in that search anything to
    make the days be anything but a
        suffering laid upon the altar for a 
        God who sees me as I truly am.

Pity nihilism does not offer me the fortitude 
of blasphemy.
