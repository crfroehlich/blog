Introductions are best done at 15,000 feet in a C-130 preparing to dive into an aggressive landing pattern over Baghdad. Two reasons. First, you can't hear anything besides the roar of the engines and the sound of pressure dropping out of your ear drums. Communication transcends language as you try to express agony and/or humor via poorly contrived hand signals, which inevitably convey meanings you do not intend to people whom you've never met. Second, explaining the rationale behind said attempts at communication is rarely anything less than hilarious. Otherwise, introductions are bound to be boring and uninspired.
